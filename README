Quake id1 v1.01 QuakeC source - fixed up by shpuld

Because of vagueness with licensing, v1.06 source isn't necessarily a good place to start from. v1.01 is more explicitely released under GPL in the quake-tools source release by id software.

Changes done to the codebase compared to v1.01:
- Eliminate all warnings that FTEQCC gives it
- Fix parm7 not being set to 0 properly in SetNewParms (cells)
- Remove DumpScore
- Prioritize other kill messages over liquid deaths(so monster killing you in water doesn't mean you sleep with the fishes)
- Fix fish count
- Add prev weapon command
- Remove a bunch of "local" keywords that are not used by any relevant compiler
- Lots of automatic and manual syntax cleanup
